Angular directive and css for layout with resizeable and split panels

No dependencies other than Angular (and jqLite that comes with it).

CSS for the gutter handle is thanks to https://nathancahill.github.io/Split.js/
(Split.js did not work for my use case, but should be considered for other projects that need a split panel).

Inspired by some StackOverflow answers and attempts to create a simple split-pane module in Angular.

Tested and works with Angular ~1.5
