Angular directive and css for layout with resizeable and split panels

Dependencies: Angular and jQuery (requires element.width() function of jQuery).

CSS for the gutter handle is thanks to https://nathancahill.github.io/Split.js/
(Split.js did not work for my use case, but should be considered for other projects that need a split panel).

Inspired by some StackOverflow answers and attempts to create a simple split-pane module in Angular.

Tested and works with Angular ~1.5.

Sample app in `index.html`
